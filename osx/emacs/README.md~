### Emacs Buffers

To list all buffers, use the list buffers command, C-x C-b.

The buffer list displays 6 columns.

| Column | Contents                                                                                            |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| M      | An asterisk (*) is displayed in this column if the buffer has been modified since it was last saved |
| R      | A percent sign (%) is displayed in this column if the buffer is read-only                           |
| Buffer | The name of the buffer                                                                              |
| Size   | Size of the buffer in Bytes                                                                         |
| Mode   | The Major mode active in the buffer                                                                 |
| File   | The name of the file, if any, load into the buffer                                                  |

To switch a buffer you can move the cursor to the line that displays the buffer.
You can also type C-x b and write the name of the buffer to open.

You can close a buffer ("kill" a buffer) by typing C-x k. If there are unsaved changes you'll be prompted to save the buffer first. If you want to save any unsaved changes in all open buffers, use the command C-x s.

### Emacs Frames

Only possible if you're running a GUI version of Emacs.

To create a new frame, use the command C-x 5 2.
To delete the current frame, use C-x 5 0.
To delete all but the current frame, use C-x 5 1.


## Ivy

Ivy is a generic completion mechanism for Emacs.

## Counsel

`ivy-mode` ensures that any Emacs command using `completing-read-function` uses ivy for completion.

Counsel takes this further, providing versions of common Emacs commands that are customised to make the best use of Ivy.

** GENERAL NOTES

** EMACS MANUAL NOTES

## MAJOR MODES

Every buffer processes a major mode.
This determines the behavior of Emacs while in that buffer.
The mode line usually shows the name of the current major mode. 

The least specialized major mode is called *Fundamental model*
This mode has no mode-specific redefinitions or variable settings.

Most major modes fall into three major groups.
The first group contains modes for normal text, either plain or with mark-up (text, html, sgml, tex, outline).
The second group contains modes for specific programming languages (Lisp, C, Fortran, others)

The third group consists of major modes that are not associated directly with files; they are used in buffers created for specific purposes by Emacs.

Examples include:
  - Dired mode for buffers made by Dired
  - Message mode for buffers made by *C-x m*
  - Shell mode for buffers used to communicate with an inferior shell process.

Emacs usually sets the major mode automatically, when you first visit a file or create a buffer.
You can switch to another mode by using an M-x command.
Press M-x and then write the name of the mode followed by -mode.
There's noway to "turn off" a major mode. Instead you must switch to a different one.

The default of major-mode determines the major mode to use for files that do not specify a major mode, and for new buffers created with C-x b.

("W" "Work Tasks" tags-todo "+work-email) ;; will show all tasks that include the tag work and don't include the tag email

Doesn't matter in which file you are, just do *M-x org-capture* and then press *tt* to capture a TODO to the tasks.org file.

You can also use it for journaling. Instead of *tt* press *jj* and it will be added to the journal.org file. It can capture many entries per day and keep it sorted.

You can also capture metrics. Check how it's configured on the *orgmode.el* file and you can improve it from there.

Create a todo in the habits.org file and schedule it.
Set style with *M-x org-set-property*, or *C-c C-x p*

ON OPERATORS AND MOTIONS

Many commands that change text are made from an operator and a motion.
d motion

d is the delete operator
motion is what the operator will operate on

w - until the start of the next word
e - until the end of the current word
$ - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character

USING A COUNT FOR A MOTION
Typing a number before a motion repeats it that many times.

2w move the cursor two words forward
3e move the cursos to the end of the third word forward
0 move the cursor to the start of the line
g_ move the cursor to the end of the line

USING A COUNT TO DELETE MORE
d number motion
Position yourself in the beginning of a word (under first char)
Type d2w to delete the first two words

OPERATING ON LINES
Due to the frequency of whole line deletion, the designers of Vi decided it would be easier 
to simply type two d's to delete a line.

dd deletes the current line
2dd deletes 2 lines

THE UNDO COMMAND
u undo the last commands
U to fix a whole line.
C-R Redo

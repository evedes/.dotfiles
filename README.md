## DOTFILES

The purpose of this repo is to gather in one place all my config files, install notes and concernings about configuring my machines.

I've merged three repos into this one so expect some turbulence and under construction shenanigans for the next weeks.

### 01. OSX

[INSTALL LOG](/osx/docs/install-log.md): where I've registered every tweak I've made while installing OSX

[EXTRA TWEAKS](/osx/docs/tweaks.md): some extra tweaking that one might need

[COMMAND LINE ALIAS](/osx/alias/.alias): helpers I want to have at my fingertips

[VSCODE SHORTCUTS](/osx/docs/vscode-notes.md): where I keep my most used shortcuts registry

### 02. LINUX

[INSTALL LOG](/linux/docs/install-log.md): where I've registered every tweak I've made while installing UBUNTU

[EXTRA TWEAKS](/linux/docs/tweaks.md): some extra tweaking that one might need

[COMMAND LINE ALIAS](/linux/alias/.alias): helpers I want to have at my fingertips

[VSCODE SHORTCUTS](/linux/docs/vscode-notes.md): where I keep my most used shortcuts registry

### 03. EMACS

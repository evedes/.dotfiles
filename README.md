## DOTFILES

The purpose of this repo is to gather in one place all my config files, install notes and concerns about my machines config.

### 01. OSX

[INSTALL LOG](/osx/docs/install-log.md): where I've registered every tweak I've made while installing *OSX*

[COMMAND LINE ALIAS](/osx/alias/.alias): helpers I want to have at my fingertips

### 02. PopOS

[INSTALL LOG](/linux/docs/install-log.md): where I've registered every tweak I've made while installing *PopOS*

[COMMAND LINE ALIAS](/linux/alias/.alias): helpers I want to have at my fingertips

[VSCODE SHORTCUTS](/linux/docs/vscode-notes.md): where I keep my most used shortcuts registry

### 03. Arch Linux

Btw, I use Arch!

[INSTALL LOG](/arch/docs/install-log.md): where I've registered every tweak I've made while installing *ARCH*


### 04. Emacs

Though I don't need Emacs to do *Clojure*, it has became my favourite computer game. Plus, there are a lot of amazing features one can grab out of Emacs such as Org Mode.

I've started my Emacs config from scratch, and at this point all I've been doing is in this repo:

[EMACS NOTES](/emacs/notes/emacs-notes.org)

[EMACS LITERATE CONFIG](/emacs/config/emacs-config.org)

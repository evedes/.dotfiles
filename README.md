# EDO'S DOTFILES 🌈

The purpose of this repo is to gather in one place all my config files, install notes and concerns about my machines config.

The eternal work in progress 🔥

# 01. OSX

[INSTALL LOG](/osx/docs/install-log.md): where I've registered every tweak I've made while installing _OSX_

[COMMAND LINE ALIAS](/osx/alias/.alias): helpers I want to have at my fingertips

# 02. PopOS

[INSTALL LOG](/popos/docs/install-log.md): where I've registered every tweak I've made while installing _PopOS_

[COMMAND LINE ALIAS](/popos/alias/.alias): helpers I want to have at my fingertips

[VSCODE SHORTCUTS](/popos/docs/vscode-notes.md): where I keep my most used shortcuts registry

# 03. Arch Linux

Btw, I use Arch!

[INSTALL LOG](/arch/docs/install-log.md): where I've registered every tweak I've made while installing _ARCH_

# 04. Emacs

Though I don't need Emacs to do _Clojure_, it has became my favourite computer game. Plus, there are a lot of amazing features one can grab out of Emacs such as Org Mode.

I've started my Emacs config from scratch, and at this point all I've been doing is in this repo:

[EMACS NOTES](/emacs/notes/emacs-notes.org)

[EMACS LITERATE CONFIG](/emacs/config/emacs-config.org)

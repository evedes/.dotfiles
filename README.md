## DOTFILES

The purpose of this repo is to gather in one place all my config files, install notes and concernings about configuring my machines. I've merged three repos into this one so expect some turbulence and under construction shenanigans for the next weeks.

### 01. OSX

[INSTALL LOG](/osx/docs/install-log.md)

### 02. LINUX

[INSTALL LOG](/linux/docs/install-log.md)

### 03. EMACS

[Emacs](/emacs)
